1. Define a function to retrieve emails from a Gmail account:
    - Authenticate with Gmail API or IMAP library.
    - Fetch the latest email(s) from the inbox.

2. Define a function to parse the email content:
    - Input: Email content as a string.
    - Output: Dictionary containing extracted information.

    2.1. Use NLP library (e.g., spaCy or NLTK) to tokenize and parse the email content.
    2.2. Identify relevant entities such as dates, locations, and other key information using named entity recognition (NER) or regex patterns.
    2.3. Extract pickup and drop-off dates, locations, truck type, weight of shipment, and any other relevant details from the parsed email content.
    2.4. Populate a dictionary with the extracted information.

3. Define a function to check for missing information:
    - Input: Extracted information dictionary.
    - Output: List of missing information.

    3.1. Check if essential information (e.g., pickup date, drop-off location) is missing from the extracted information dictionary.
    3.2. Compile a list of missing information.

4. Define a function to generate the freight quote:
    - Input: Extracted information dictionary.
    - Output: Freight quote.

    4.1. If all required information is available:
        4.1.1. Use the extracted information to query the Zuum API or another freight quoting service.
        4.1.2. Retrieve the freight quote.
        4.1.3. Return the freight quote.
    4.2. If any required information is missing:
        4.2.1. Print or log a message indicating the missing information.
        4.2.2. Return None or an error code.

5. Define a function to send feedback to the user:
    - Input: Missing information list, Email address of the user.
    - Output: None.

    5.1. Compose an email listing the missing information.
    5.2. Send the email to the user's email address.

6. Define a main function to orchestrate the email parsing and freight quoting process:
    6.1. Retrieve the latest email from the Gmail account.
    6.2. Parse the email content using the parsing function.
    6.3. Check for missing information using the missing information function.
    6.4. If missing information exists:
        6.4.1. Send feedback to the user about the missing information.
    6.5. If no missing information:
        6.5.1. Generate the freight quote using the freight quote function.
        6.5.2. Print or display the freight quote to the user.

7. Call the main function to initiate the email parsing and freight quoting process.

8. Handle exceptions and errors gracefully throughout the process.
